# johanrosenkilde's dotfiles

I'm currently running a MacBook Pro with Mac OS X.

I used to run Linux (Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.) and I've kept a number of
dotfiles from that system that I currently don't use actively.

## Emacs

I have extensive configuration of Emacs. The `.emacs` file in this repository is
mostly a forward to the main configuration which [has its own repo](https://github.com/johanrosenkilde/dotemacs).
